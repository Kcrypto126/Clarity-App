# Clarity App - Supabase Schema Design

### Node Unlock Rules

Table: `node_unlock_rules`

Defines rules for when nodes should be unlocked based on answers to questions.

| target_sanity_node_ref | text | ID of the node to unlock in Sanity |

## Introductory Assessment Flow

For the introductory assessment:

1. When a new user opens the app, the system automatically unlocks nodes with `nodeType = 'intro_assessment'` (these nodes are defined in Sanity)
2. The user completes these intro assessment nodes by answering their questions
3. Based on answers and the `node_unlock_rules` table, additional nodes are unlocked for the user
4. After completing the intro assessment, the user is prompted to register to save their progress

## Relationships and Indexes

### Foreign Key Constraints

- `user_node_states.user_id` references `users.id`
- `user_responses.user_id` references `users.id`
- `journal_entries.user_id` references `users.id`
- `user_responses.journal_entry_id` references `journal_entries.id`

### Indexes

- `user_node_states`: (user_id, sanity_node_ref)
- `user_responses`: (user_id, sanity_node_ref, sanity_question_ref)
- `journal_entries`: (user_id, created_at)
- `node_questions`: (sanity_node_ref)
- `node_unlock_rules`: (source_sanity_node_ref), (target_sanity_node_ref)

## Row-Level Security Policies

All tables will have row-level security enabled with policies that ensure users can only access their own data:

```sql
-- Example policy for user_node_states
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own node states"
  ON user_node_states
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

Similar policies will be created for all user data tables.

## Real-time Subscriptions

The following table will be enabled for real-time subscriptions to support immediate UI updates:

- `user_node_states` - For updating the mind map as users progress

## Vector Search Integration

For implementing vector similarity searches:

- We'll generate and store embeddings of nodes and user content
- Supabase's pgvector extension will be used for vector similarity searches
- This will enable "related nodes" functionality based on user responses and journal entries

## Migration Strategy

1. Create tables in Supabase
2. Set up row-level security policies
3. Configure real-time subscriptions
4. Create initial indexes
5. Test with sample data before production
